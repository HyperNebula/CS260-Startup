**CultureCache** is a media tracker website, allowing you to track and record all forms of media that you have consumed, such as movies, books, shows, and video games, all in one convenient place.

> [!NOTE]
> Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown

- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology

### Elevator pitch

Your taste in books, movies, and games makes you who you are. Yet, there is no single website to track it all; instead one website for books, another for movies, others for games. **CultureCache** solves all of this by unifying your media life. It is a comprehensive tracking dashboard that allows users to search, rate, and log movies, books, and all types of games in one centralized location. **CultureCache** also introduces a social layer, allowing users to see a live feed of what their friends are currently finishing or rating. Stop toggling between three different apps; track your entire digital life in one place!

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - HTML will provide the basic website structure, with pages for login, public feed, and your library.
- **CSS** - Styling for website that is clean and easily readable. Light and dark mode options. Usable on computer and phone.
- **React** - Provides a login landing page form, public update feed flow, displaying user's library, and showing search/add media interface.
- **Service** - Backend service that allows for:
    - logging in
    - retrieving user media input
    - searching for that media in the correct database API 
- **DB/Login** - Stores user/login info, each user's library using data from the APIs, each library tied to their specific login information.
- **WebSocket** - After a user updates or changes something in their library, this change gets broadcasted to every other user.
